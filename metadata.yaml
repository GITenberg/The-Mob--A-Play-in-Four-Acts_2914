description: This 1914 drama follows a moral politician, Stephen More, as he watches
  his powerful country plan an attack on a small country. What's worse, his government
  is using trumped up charges in order to overtake and add the small country to their
  empire. More feels powerless as pressures from his family and parliament keep him
  quiet.
